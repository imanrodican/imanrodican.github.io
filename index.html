    <h3>Claim:</h3>
    <p>There is a long continuous tube that loops at least once inside of the mystery box.</p>
    <h3>Evidence:</h3>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that has a funnel at the top, and a tube at the bottom, and the insides of the box were completely concealed. As a class, we poured water into the funnel and noticed that different amounts of water would come out of the tube at the bottom. Certain trials resulted in no water coming out, while other trials resulted in more water coming out. We replicated the mystery black box to the best of our ability, and poured different amounts of water through the funnel, and measured how much water came out of the other end. Some of our trials resulted in no water coming out of our model (ex. Trial 1: Input 100mL, Output 0mL), while others resulted in more water coming out (ex. Trial 23: Input 300mL, Output 310mL). This evidence lines up with data from the actual black box, as there were trials that resulted in no water coming out, the same amount of water coming out, and more water coming out. </p>
    <h3>Reasoning:</h3>
    <p>A model is a scaled down version of the actual mystery black box that attempts to replicate the insides of the box. Our trials support the claim we made because we executed our idea, and received the same results as the original black box. Trials from the original mystery black box resulted in less water coming out, more water coming out, and the same amount of water coming out. When we built our model with loops, we received the same results as the original box. For example, Trial 1: Input 100mL, Output 0mL, and Trial 23: Input 300mL, Output 310mL. If there werenâ€™t loops included in our model, and the tubing was just straight, we would receive an equal amount of input/output water with each trial. The loops allow water to get stuck in the tubes, explaining why some trials have less water coming out. The loops also account for more water coming out, as the water stuck in the tube can be pushed out using more water from a new trial.</p>
